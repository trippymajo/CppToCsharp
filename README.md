[CppToCsharp - A quick transition guide](CppToCSharp.md)

# About Repo
This repo is my own kind of research work for the full transitioning from C++ to C#.
This means I want to write a C# code in C#, not a C++ in C#.
With all my expirience I will explaing mosth of the C# things with most common things which is used daily in C++ production.
In order to make this easy for pointer lovers understand what is going on in ~~Java~~ C# language.

## Version
C# 13
.NET 9

## Feedback
If you find something what is need to be written, please don't be shy and help me with this.
But keep in mind, that the whole guide uses concept: About everything important, but in few words. 'Cos I dont want it to be a long-read book with over 800+ pages saying "learn C# in 2 hours" :D
